1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- I would also like to keep practicing how to create efficient code. I will go over these exercises to see if there is a way to reduce any repeated evaluations in my code, as well as see how other people logic through them. I can make time later tonight or tomorrow to do so.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- I don't have any questions right now, since I don't know what I don't know.. But if I come across something I don't know, I will look to Google and/or StackOverflow, or ask for for help.
